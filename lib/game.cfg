//  general game description format:
//
//  game <id> <"title"> [by <publisher>] 
//    [with <count> [seens]] [inherits <id>] 
//	  [for <target>] [using <key|[no key]>]
//
//  target := <AVG32|RealLive[Max]|Kinetic|Siglus[Engine]>] <version> <compiler>
//  version := n.n.n.n
//  compiler := integer (11002, 110002, etc)
//
//  key := key from <offset> for <length>: <hex> [and <key>][and ...]
//
//  whitespace and comments are ignored (we hope!)
//
//  this file can help rldev determine what game it is working
//  with so that it can automatically determine which, if any
//  game specific encryption keys to use for the extraction of 
//  compiled bytecode or when recompiling modified game source 
//  data.  it also defines an inheritance relationship where
//  multiple releases may share a base of source text.  RLdev
//  will attempt to identify and factor out those lines which
//  are shared in multiple variants, reducing the workload in
//  translating multiple variants simultaneously.  
//
//  an alternate means of identifying the current project is to
//  include an rldev.cfg file in the working directory, which
//  rldev may generate itself (or at least a stub file) when it
//  is unable to determine the target.  The available keys will
//  be tried if seen data appears to be encrypted.  If an existing
//  key is able to decrypt the data, it will be included in the stub.

//  Note: the key specifications may seem a little obtuse, but since
//  the exact specification is internal to VisualArt's, the best
//  format to use is one that is open and flexible.

//  Currently the larger size decryption keys begin with a skip
//  region (data is not encrypted) which is followed by four
//  subkeys repeated per the following recipe: 8:8:1:7.  
//
//  <skip 256><decrypt 8:8:1:7>* 
//
//  This skip/decrypt process is repeated for the length of the
//  data after decompressing the data (using a standard xor key
//  used in all RealLive based games.
//
//  The decryption scheme employed is complex enough to keep the
//  average visual novel user from the internal details, without
//  locking out those who are willing to expend a little effort.
//  In this way it functions as a quality filter, like the sword
//  in the stone, ensuring only the most obsessive and dedicated
//  translation teams, such as #fluffy, even face the challenge.
